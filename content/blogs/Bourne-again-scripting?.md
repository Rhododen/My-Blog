While we may all appreciate the role Robert Downey Jr(Tony Stark/Iron man) played in the MCU. I’m pretty sure we all know that a larger part of his conversations and actions in the cinematic universe is based on a script the writers sent to him.  

Yeah, I know RDJ was born for the Iron suit, he’s everyone’s favourite(I might have shed a tear when Iron man died) and it is said that most of our favourite lines in the MCU was thought up on the spot by RDJ and the directors thought them good enough to keep them in the movies. Yet, we cannot deny that the success of the franchise depended largely on the script the directors handed over to him when the shooting started.

You must be wondering if this newsletter is going to be about RDJ and the MCU.

Nope.

The same way, the script tells RDJ what to do and say on set, Bash scripts tell the Bash shell what it should do. But it’s more than that. 

Bash scripting is a powerful tool that allows you to automate repetitive tasks  and run complex commands quickly and efficiently.

So next time, when you want to run a process, rather than giving the commands one at a time, consider writing a script instead which can be reused or shared.

See ya!
