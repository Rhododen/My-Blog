It is responsible for the execution of processes, handling of system operations, and management of system resources amongst other things.  But there is a small problem there - The  kernel \u0026lsquo;understands\u0026rsquo; only binary language, which is basically ones and zeros.

The shell accepts the commands entered in the language recognizable by the user and translates them to binary language for the kernel. Without shells, it is practically impossible for a person to utilise the features and functionality offered by the kernel installed on their system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Terminal\u003c/em\u003e: The user interacts with the shell through the terminal. This is  where the user enters a written command. The shell then takes those commands and interprets them into binary language which it passes to the kernel. The kernel finally takes the binary language commands and executes the task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are different types of shells each with its own set of unique features and functionalities.

This may be a major reason why it‚Äôs the most popular. Another reason is that Bash is open-source software, meaning that anyone can contribute to its development and improvement and this has brought about a large community of Bash users so you are more likely to get help online whenever you run into a Bash-related problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I also want to mention the versatility of Bash. Bash offers a wide range of features and it has amazing shell scripting capabilities.

You can decide to do it manually, one at a time  and get immediate feedback by using the shell prompt. The shell prompt typically displays information such as the user‚Äôs username, hostname and the current working directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=/images/terminal2.webp\u003e\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003ekc is the username, localhost is the host name, ~ is the home directory(/home/kc)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also pass commands to the shell by writing scripts.
