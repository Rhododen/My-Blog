      <description>Hey there!
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what happens when you enter a URL into your browser’s address bar.
When you tell your browser you want to visit www.aliexpress.com, your browser is clueless. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t know where that is, which is why it has to translate that address (www.aliexpress.com) to a format it can read. This process is called DNS resolution(Don’t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is).
Your browser contacts a DNS server and a conversation like this happens.</description>

      <description>Hey there!
Do you know you don&amp;rsquo;t speak the same language as your computer? While you may be multilingual, your computer only speaks and understands one language. Binary.
Right. You may be able to speak Spanish and English but your computer can only speak ones and zeros.
How do I then make my computer do what I want it to do?
The Kernel: The kernel is the core of the operating system (Think of the engine in a car).</description>
